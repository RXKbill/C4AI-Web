Sundial is a family of **generative** time series foundation models. The model can make zero-shot predictions for **point** and **probabilistic** forecasting. [[Slides]](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/8d526337afde465e87c9/) [[Poster]](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/cc2a156315e9453f99b3/) [[Intro (CN)]](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/y3sc2e2lmW1sqfnoK-ZdDA).

Not only the mean or quantiles, you can estimate anything about the predictive distribution with raw generated samples.

The base version is pre-trained on **1 trillion** time points with **128M** parameters. For more information, please refer to this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00816).

**Sundial** can be viewed as an **ARMA** model (Auto-Regression and Moving-Average). Transformer learns auto-regressive token representations. Conditioned on them, TimeFlow transforms random noises into non-deterministic predictions.

**Overall Architecture**: The input time series is divided into patch tokens, which are embedded from the original continuous values. The patch embeddings are fed into a decoder-only Transformer, a stable and speedup version that learns token representations. The model is optimized using our TimeFlow Loss, a parameterized loss function that models per-token probability distribution conditioned on the learned representations, and generates multiple plausible predictions under the flow-matching framework.

## Quickstart
```
pip install transformers==4.40.1 # Use this version and Python 3.10 for stable compatibility
```

```
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM

# load pretrain model
# supports different lookback/forecast lengths
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained('thuml/sundial-base-128m', trust_remote_code=True) 

# prepare input
batch_size, lookback_length = 1, 2880 
seqs = torch.randn(batch_size, lookback_length)

# Note that Sundial can generate multiple probable predictions
forecast_length = 96 
num_samples = 20

output = model.generate(seqs, max_new_tokens=forecast_length, num_samples=num_samples)

# use raw predictions for mean/quantiles/confidence-interval estimation
print(output.shape) 
```

More examples for predicting quantiles or confidence intervals are provided in this [notebook](https://github.com/thuml/Sundial/blob/main/examples/quickstart_zero_shot_generation.ipynb).

## Evaluation

We evaluate performance on the following benchmarks:

- [GIFT-Eval (1st MASE)](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/64fbe24a2d20ced4e91de38a/3BxatwayhK5GAoqMf1oHv.png) [[Leaderboard]](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Salesforce/GIFT-Eval).
- [Time-Series-Library (1st MSE/MAE)](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/64fbe24a2d20ced4e91de38a/5VqnFwWTWoYz877Zkluiw.png).
- [FEV Leaderboard](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/64fbe24a2d20ced4e91de38a/mrKL9QmX-aX8rCiwxKgmA.png).

We are actively working around it and are glad to hear suggestions and noteworthy cases :)
